# SPA Static Downloader (webScrapingDjango)

**SPA Static Downloader** is a Django web application that lets you generate static, downloadable ZIP archives of JavaScript-heavy Single Page Applications (SPAs) like those built with React, Vue, Angular, or Svelte. It uses Playwright to render the site in a real browser (Firefox), downloads all assets (HTML, CSS, JS, images, fonts), and packages everything for easy hosting on platforms like Netlify or GitHub Pages.
